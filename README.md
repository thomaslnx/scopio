# 📝 About this challenge

<p>
  This project has the intention of the show of what are my coding skills for an open role for a software company. The challenge has two parts: the backend and the front end. The first already done is the backend. Right below I'll describe all technologies that I use to achieve this result.
</p>

<br/>

# ⚙️ Applied Technologies

# Backend

- NodeJS;
- ExpressJS;
- TypeScript;
- Docker;
- Docker Compose;
- MomentJS;
- ESlint;
- Prettier;
- Husky;
- PostgreSQL;
- Sequelize ORM;
- GraphQL;
- Apollo Server;

<br/>

# 🛠️ How to execute locally

```Backend```

***You'll need to have Docker installed into your system***

Then make the clone by following the link:
[Full Stack Marcos Challenge](https://github.com/edgareler/marcos-fullstack-test)

After you have cloned the repo install all the project's dependencies. Enter in frontend and backend folder and run the command:

```yarn``` or ```npm install```

Obs: case show up a message telling you that .git file was not found just run the command: ```git init````

To run the backend project enter inside backend folder and run the command: 
<br />
```yarn backend-docker``` or ```npm run backend-docker```

<br/>

To run frontend project run enter in frontend folder and run the command:
<br />
```yarn start``` or ```npm run start```

OBS: for the frontend project maybe be necessary to set API address to the your local environment. For this go to frontend folder -> src -> services -> api -> index.ts. In the uri apollo property put your local ip address.

🎉 🎉 🎉 Well, at this point your project is set up and running. So, you can access the server and can make the backend operations, go to your browser and type: http://localhost:3000/graphql.

The Docker and Docker Compose can be possible to contain all the backend application, including the database and some initial data.
